# Etch-a-Sketch

A digital drawing toy, in which a sketchpad made of 20x20 cubes is currently offered. By moving the mouse and holding the left click, the cube will change color. The user can choose whether to draw in black or to receive random colors for each cube. The user is also offered an eraser to erase the color of the desired cube, and finally a "reset" button to restart the colors of all the cubes.

The plan is to add the functionality of changing the number of columns and rows, so that the user can enter the number of cubes he will have available.
